The following steps will stand up a local install of Next.js.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your computer:

- [Node 16](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM 8](https://nodejs.org/en/)

> If you run into issues with NPM installing, try using `npm i --legacy-peer-deps` instead.

## Install

**Step 1: Clone the frontend framework with `create-next-app`**

```bash
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/WebDevStudios/nextjs-wordpress-starter/tree/main --use-npm nextjs-wordpress-starter
```

**Step 2: Change directories**

```bash
cd nextjs-wordpress-starter
```

## Setup ENV Variables

ENV variables are like constants in `wp-config.php`. They're required in order for things like authentication with WordPress and other 3rd party services.

**Step 1: Copy the [sample ENV file](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/nextjs-wordpress-starter/blob/main/.env.sample):**

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

**Step 2: Open the `.env` file in your code editor**

**Step 3: Add your credentials and save the file**

Learn more about configuring in the [ENV Var documentation](/docs/frontend/env-variables).

## Start the Development Server

You can kick-off a development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

It'll take a few seconds to compile, and then you can view the frontend at <http://localhost:3000> You did it! üëèüèª

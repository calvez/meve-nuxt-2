To ensure that all contributors formatting their code the same, our Next.js Starter includes support for:

- [Editor Config](https://editorconfig.org/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)

We also use pre-commit hooks to prevent "bad commits" from being checked in.

## VS Code Support

Check out the [recommended VSCode extensions](/docs/other/recommended-extensions) to help enable real-time linting.

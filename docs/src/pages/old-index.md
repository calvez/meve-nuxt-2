**A headless starter for WordPress powered by Next.js**

Demo: <https://nextjs-wordpress-starter.vercel.app/>

## Introduction

Querying a REST-API or GraphQL endpoint and looping over blog posts is where many tutorials about _"headless WordPress"_ stop. You'd be hard pressed to find a deep-dive into advanced functionality because: **headless WordPress is hard**.

At WebDevStudios we believe that **WordPress is so much more than a blog**-- and our clients require support for things like: SEO, menus, forms, previews, search, comments, authentication, custom post types, custom fields, etc...

With this framework, **we've figured out the "hard stuff" and placed the sum of our knowledge into something both the community and our future projects could use as a jumping off point.**

## Next Steps

Head on over to the [Getting Started](/docs) doc to learn more.

> NOTE: This is prerelease software. We will ðŸ’¯ introduce breaking changes.
